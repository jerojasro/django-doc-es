Translation of the Django tutorial to spanish

How to collaborate
##################

Choose one of the available .PO files in the es/ folder (see the PROGRESS
file), mark yourself as translator, get going with it.

Workflow
########

* Translating text: edit the PO file; translate the text there as usual.
* Updating the .txt files: use po4a-translate. You should issue the command as follows:

    po4a-translate -k 0 -f text -M utf8 -L utf8 -m <ORIGINAL-RST-FILE> -l <TARGET-RST-FILE> -p <PO-FILE>

  For example, to translate the overview:

    po4a-translate -k 0 -f text -M utf8 -L utf8 -m ../original/intro/overview.txt -l rst/intro/overview.txt -p po/overview.po

* Generating the HTML version of the help: go into srt/, and type: make. That
  will create a _build/ directory with the latest HTML version of the Django
  documentation.
